Each folder is a relatively separate experiment. If you would like to compile any of these experiments for yourself, you will need bsc (the bluespec compiler). I use the AUR package =bluespec-git=. To simulate the compiled Verilog, you will need a Verilog simulator. I use the =iverilog= Arch package. Each folders' Makefile will assemble verilog and generate a simulator executable.
